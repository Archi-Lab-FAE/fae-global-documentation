### Definition:
'Write a short description (about one page) of the core domain and the value it will bring, the “value proposition.” Ignore those aspects that do not distinguish this domain model from others. Show how the domain model serves and balances diverse interests. Keep it narrow. Write this statement early and revise it as you gain new insight.' 

[Evans, E. (2015). Domain-Driven Design Reference - Definitions and Pattern Summaries, p. 42. [Online available here](http://domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DDD_Reference_2015-03.pdf)]

In our project, domains might be a bit smaller than they usually. Therefore, a Domain Vision Statement can be shorter than one page. Don't "bloat" your statement just to reach one page.
