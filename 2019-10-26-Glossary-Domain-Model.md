### Definition:
**Domain**

A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. 

**Model**

A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.

For our project, the domain model can be represented by a UML-like class diagram, depicting the important entities and [aggregates](https://fae.archi-lab.io/glossary/2019/09/06/Glossary-Aggregate.html). The aspects 
we have established in Event Storming and subsequent discussions (like events, actors, concerns etc.) need to be connected to them in a sensible way.
